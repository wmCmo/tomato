# Zach's Tomato
- An attempt to rewrite my [old Pomodoro timer](https://github.com/wmcmo/pomodoro) using React Library (+Vite) as a practice.
- This is also my first responsive application.
- The executable for Windows is available now, using Electron.
  - Release [1.0.0](https://github.com/wmCmo/tomato/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
### Usage
- Pomodoro = 25 mins of focusing
- Short Break = 5 mins
- Long Break = 15 mins break. You will get this every 2 sets of Pomodoro (i.e. every 50 + 10 mins, an hour)
### Things I want to work on
- [ ] Togglable dark theme
- [ ] Able to pin the app window
- [ ] Adjust white color
