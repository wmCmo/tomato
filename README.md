# Zach's Tomato

- An attempt to rewrite my [old Pomodoro timer](https://github.com/wmcmo/pomodoro) using React Framework (Vite) as a practice.
- This is also my first responsive application.
- v1.3.0 で日本語に対応しました
- v1.3.3 Added shortcut for toggling Play/Pause (`space`), Language (`L`), Theme (`T`).

## Usage

- Pomodoro = 25 mins of focusing
- Short Break = 5 mins
- Long Break = 15 mins break. You will get this every 2 sets of Pomodoro (i.e. every 50 + 10 mins, an hour)

## Things I want to work on

- [x] Togglable dark theme
- [ ] Able to pin the app window
- [x] Adjust white color
- [ ] Countdown timer (maybe in `/timer`) 
- [ ] Use `localStorage` to locally save current session number and state
