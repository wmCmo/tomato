# Zach's Tomato
- An attempt to rewrite my [old Pomodoro timer](https://github.com/wmcmo/pomodoro) using React Library as a practice.
- This is also my first responsive application.
- The executable download will be available _soon_.
### Usage
- Pomodoro = 25 mins of focusing
- Short Break = 5 mins
- Long Break = 15 mins break. You will get this every 2 sets of Pomodoro (i.e. every 50 + 10 mins, an hour)
